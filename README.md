#### Proc Gen Bullet Hell

An work-in-progress experiment to create a procedurally generated [bullet hell game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Bullet_hell_and_niche_appeal) using web tech.

The challenge / goal is to create new guns that are procedurally generated but reasonably balanced.

Stretch goals would be to procedurally generate enemies and weapons as well that are reaonsably balanced.
